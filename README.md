## 📖 About

JustLingo is a simple programming language with two boxes (A and B) that can hold numeric values. Players solve challenges by writing programs using a limited set of commands to manipulate these values.

### Available Commands

**Basic Operations** (All Challenges):
- `AB` - Move the content of A to B
- `BA` - Move the content of B to A
- `IB` - Add 1 to the current value of B
- `DB` - Subtract 1 from the current value of B
- `MA` - Multiply A by 3

**Advanced Operations** (Challenges 4 & 5):
- `RB` - Read an input into B
- `PB` - Print B
- `SAB` - Add the value of B into A
- `FBJn` - If B is not 0, jump to line n
